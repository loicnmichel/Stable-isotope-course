These files are intended as material for the practical part of the course "Applications of stable isotopes in marine ecosystems", taught by Gilles Lepoint & Loïc Michel at University of Liège.

One script deals with trophic position estimation. It's mostly based on Claudio Quezada-Romegialli's example scripts for his package tRophicPosition. If you are looking for more example scripts and guidance to use the package, please visit https://github.com/clquezada/tRophicPosition and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tRophicPosition/vignettes/.

The other script deals with ellipse and convex hull-based isotopic niche metrics. It's mostly based on Andrew Jackson's example scripts for his package SIBER. If you are looking for more example scripts and guidance to use the package, please visit https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/SIBER and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIBER/vignettes/.
