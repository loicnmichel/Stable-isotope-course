These files are intended as material for the practical part of the course "Applications of stable isotopes in marine ecosystems", taught by Gilles Lepoint & Loïc Michel at University of Liège.

The first script deals with stable isotope mixing models. It's mostly based on Andrew Parnell's and Brian Stock's example scripts for their package simmr and MixSIAR, respectively. If you are looking for more example scripts and guidance to use the packages, please visit

The second script deals with trophic position estimation. It's mostly based on Claudio Quezada-Romegialli's example scripts for his package tRophicPosition. If you are looking for more example scripts and guidance to use the package, please visit https://github.com/clquezada/tRophicPosition and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tRophicPosition/vignettes/.

The third script deals with ellipse and convex hull-based isotopic niche metrics. It's mostly based on Andrew Jackson's example scripts for his package SIBER. If you are looking for more example scripts and guidance to use the package, please visit https://github.com/AndrewLJackson/SIBER and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SIBER/vignettes/.

Solutions to the "independent work" questions and tasks are available upon request at loic.michel[at]uliege[dot]be.
